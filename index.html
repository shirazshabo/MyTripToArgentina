	<h1> My Trip To Argentina </h1>
	<br> <br>
	<h2> A Little About Me</h2> 
	<img src = "imagesMySite/me.jpg">
	<p> Hi, my name is Shiraz. I was born in Petach - Tikva, raised in Modii'n, and just recently moved to Rehovot with my boyfriend. 
	I am 25 years old. I completed military service, did a bachelor's degree, completed a QA course, and now I am learning automation.
	During one of the vacations I had during my degree I went for a month and a half on a trip to Argentina with a good friend. </p>
	<h2> Buenos Aires </h2>
	<p> We started the trip from Buenos Aires - we explored the city, we joined to zumba classes, we went to Boca Street and we watch a match 
	between Boca & River. We also went to two shows of celebrities we know from TV series we saw as children. </p>
	<h3> First show - Una Semana Nada Mas</h3>
	<p> This is a comedic show starring Nicolas Vazquez and Benjamin Rojas. The show was very funny and the actors were great! You need to
	understand Spanish in order to understand the plot. In the aduience we saw another celebrity that we knew, and at the end of the show the actors came out to us and we took some
	pictures with them. You can see the pictures in the gallery. </p>

	<h3> Second show - 100 Metros Cuadrados </h3>
	<p> This is a comedic drama starring Florencia Bertotti and Stefano de Gregorio. We did not stop laughing throughout the show. 
	At the end of the show the actors came out and we took some pictures with them. You can see the pictures in the gallery.</p>
	<h2> Ushuaia </h2>
	<p> After Buenos Aires we moved to Ushuaia, There we did the route called Laguna Esmeralda. It snowed a lot, it was cold and a bit
	dangerous, but it was a lot of fun. It is a very beautiful trip. It was one of the best and most memorable moments of the trip. </p>

	<h2> El Calafate </h2>
	<p> We were there for 2-3 days. We just wanted to go to the Perito Moreno - It is a huge glacier that every few minutes part of it 
	shatters and if you are lucky you can see it happen.</p>

	<h2> Bariloche </h2>
	<p> We really loved Bariloche! It is so beautiful and there is so much to do - you can travel, you can just explore the city, you can do a 
	bicycle toure and wine tasting, you can find very good food and more. </p>
	<h2> Cordoba & Mendoza </h2>
	<p> The truth is there is not much to do there. We went there because we arrived just in time for the OctoberFest and because there 
	was a show of a singer we love. We also did there bicycle toure and wine tasting, and it was so much fun. </p>
	<h2> Iguazo </h2>
	<p> We went to Iguazu falls - we went to both Argentina side and Brazil side. In the Brazil side we went parachuting and it was amazing!
	This place is so beautiful! </p>
